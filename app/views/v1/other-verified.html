      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What is a Companies House personal code </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Your Companies House personal code connects your 
        verified identity to our records. This is so that we know the correct
         person is linked to the personal details we have on file. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When you may need your Companies House personal code</h2>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>as part of some other company filings</li>
        <li>when you are appointed as a director</li>
        <li>when you are appointed as a PSC</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Keeping your information secure </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Identity verification makes it much more difficult for 
        criminals to impersonate someone, but not impossible. Keep this information 
        secure, as you would with other unique codes such as your Unique Taxpayer 
        Reference (UTR) for HMRC. Only share the code with people you trust to file 
        on your behalf.
